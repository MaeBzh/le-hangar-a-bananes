## My VitePress-powered blog
Welcome to my blog powered by VitePress, a static site generator based on Vue.js and Markdown.

You can visit the live site at https://www.le-hangar-a-bananes.fr.

## Why I chose VitePress
I chose VitePress for several reasons:

- It's **fast** and **easy to use**: VitePress uses the Vue.js template engine to make web development quick and easy.
- It's **flexible**: VitePress allows you to easily customize your site using Vue.js templates and components.
- It's **serverless**: VitePress generates a static site that can be hosted on any web hosting service, meaning you don't have to worry about server configuration or databases.

## How to use this GitHub repo
This GitHub repo contains the source code for my VitePress-powered blog. To use this code on your own site, you can:

- Install dependencies using `npm install`.
- Modify the Markdown files in the `src/blog` directory to add your own articles.
- Run `npm run dev` to launch a local development server.
- Run `npm run build` to generate the static site in the `.vitepress/dist` directory.

You can also use the `npm run serve` command to launch a local development server that will automatically refresh with any changes you make to the code.
